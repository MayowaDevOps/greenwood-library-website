# ðŸ“˜ Git Capstone Project

## Summary

This project is a simulation of a real-world web development collaboration using **Git** and **GitHub**. The goal was to build a basic, interactive web story using HTML pages while demonstrating version control skills such as branching, merging, conflict resolution, and team-based collaboration.

We collaboratively created and modified multiple web pages using Git best practices like creating feature branches, staging, committing, pushing, and raising pull requests (PRs).

## Branches Created

- `main` â€“ The base branch containing the initial web structure.
- `add-book-reviews` â€“ Morgan's branch to add a book reviews page.
- `update-events` â€“ Jamie's branch to update the events section.
